"""AND-OR proof hypergraph for the hybrid GNN/PLN search
A hypergraph rooted at the
original goal, whose nodes are subgoals (carrying both the GNN's prior
probability and the PLN-derived STV) and whose hyperedges are tactic
applications. Applying a tactic can spawn *several* subgoals that must
*all* be proven — that is the "hyper" part (an AND-edge), and alternative
tactics on the same goal are OR-alternatives.

Conventional choice and its trade-off:
this implementation keeps each subgoal node attached to exactly one parent
edge (a tree of AND-hyperedges, as in most neural-prover search trees — DeepHOL/
HOList, GPT-f). A fully general HTPS-style hypergraph additionally *merges*
syntactically-identical subgoals discovered via different branches into  one
shared, multi-parent node, which needs more involved backprop (a node can feed
several parents). That sharing is *not* implemented here — it is left as a
documented open item. What *is* implemented is cycle-breaking: a subgoal identical
to one of its own ancestors is treated as unprovable along that path (standard in tree-search
provers to avoid infinite regress), using the same concrete
(non-normalized) state fingerprint the translator recommends for exact
branch identity.
